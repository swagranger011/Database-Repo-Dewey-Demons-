Vision Statement: 
	We are developing the library database product that is intended to streamline library operations, provide an efficient, user-friendly, and scalable solution for managing library resources. Our goal is to create a system that simplifies book tracking, member management, and borrowing transactions while allowing librarians to generate reports. This will enhance the overall library experience for staff and readers.

Scope Statement: 
	Database Design: Developing a database to store and manage data entities such as books, authors, members, borrowing transactions, and library staff.
	User Interface: Designing an interface for librarians to interact and manage the database, including features for adding, updating, and deleting records. Also, designing an interface for clients to search for books, reserve items, and check book status.
	Query and Report Generation: Implementing functionality to generate reports and answer common queries, such as overdue books, popular titles, and member borrowing history.
	Data Security: Ensuring secure access to the database with role-based permissions for librarians and staff.
	Documentation: Providing comprehensive documentation for the database schema, user interface, and report generation tools.
